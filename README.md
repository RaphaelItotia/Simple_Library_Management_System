# Library Management System Using SQL 

## Introduction:
I recently visited a local library where I was greeted by shelves of books and a librarian armed with a pen and checkout ledger. Curiosity got me, so I asked, “How’s managing all these books going?”
With a sigh, she told me about the struggles; tracking overdue books felt like a detective work and every time a book was borrowed, she’d pray the borrower would return it on time. As she continued, I realized that this was the perfect problem for an SQL project! If she was going to keep those books in order, she needed a system that wouldn’t crumble. And so, the Library Management System was born.

## Problem statement:
The library is struggling to efficiently manage its book inventory, track user borrowings, and monitor loan returns. The manual system currently used is time-consuming, prone to human errors, and lacks real-data retrieval for managing users, books, and loans records.

## Objective:
To design and implement a relational database that will efficiently store and manage user and book data, help in tracking book borrowings, return dates, and provide real-time data on available books and overdue loans.
